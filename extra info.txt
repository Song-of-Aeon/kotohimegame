if you open kotohimegame in undertalemodtool you will find a lot of related assets to that game. this is incredibly bulky for a visual novel. i am sorry

sound effects shamelessly stolen from undertale, ace attorney, and freesound.org
MODS DONT NUKE THE GAME PLEASE

font is nova mono (normal) and determination (undertale)
engine is gamemaker 2.3
aesthetic concepts taken from undertale, ace attorney, and two games you've never heard of

our artists did not feel like making backgrounds
